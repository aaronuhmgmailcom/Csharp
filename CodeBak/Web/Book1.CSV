what are the reasons to commence a pension?",	There are several benefits in commencing a Pension from your SMSF. The obvious benefit is that you are able to commence accessing your Super Benefit after age 55 even if still working. This will help with living expenses as and when they arise.

This means that all income and capital gains the SMSF generates after the Pension is commences will be tax free. A Pension is almost the perfect investment vehicle in which to have your investments from a taxation and accessibility point of view.
