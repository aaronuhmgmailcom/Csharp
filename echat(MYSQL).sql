Irrespective of when you receive the Pension documentation, the Pension will be deemed to have commenced on the date nominated in the original application. This means that the tax benefits begin to accrue from that date notwithstanding that the documentation may not be signed until a later date.

In effect your SMSF is like an ATM where you can access any amount as a Lump Sum over and above your pension withdrawals. However always be careful that tax may be payable on Lump Sum Withdrawals if aged under 60. However with a Transition to Retirement (TRAP), you <b>cannot</b> take any Lump Sum Withdrawals whatsoever. You are limited to taking up to 10 of your Member Benefit each year as a Pension Payment only. Importantly however, to avoid this restriction your Pension is converted from a TRAP to a Simple Account Based Pension once you &ldquo;Retire&rdquo; or turn 65 enabling you to make Lump Sum Withdrawals in retirement.</p>',0),(102,328,'Nothing changes when you commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP. That is your investments stay as they are. All that happens is that you execute documentation declaring that you wish to commence accessing your super as an income stream. Even better the documentation is prepared for you when you are ready to commence your Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP. For example if your SMSF owns Cash and Shares, when you commence the Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP these assets stay as they are. You do not need to sell the Shares or transfer the Cash to another account in the above example. The documentation prepared and signed by you is all that is required to evidence that the Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP has commenced. Once the Pension commences you will no longer pay tax on income and capital gains on your Super Benefit, making this the perfect taxation investment vehicle. From your perspective you will not notice anything different about your SMSF. That is your SMSF Bank Account and Investments will be exactly as they were before commencing the Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP.',0),(103,329,'<p>\n	Given that you will no longer pay tax on income and realised capital gains on your Super Benefit, when you commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP, you will be entitled to receive all Franking Credits on Australian Share Dividends in cash from the ATO. Franking Credits simply represent tax paid by Australian companies on dividends your SMSF receives. Given that the company has paid 30 tax and no tax is payable on your Super Benefit, the entire 30 tax paid is refundable to your SMSF. <b>Example:</b> For every $10,000 received in fully franked dividend income, your SMSF receives $4,285 as a cash refund from the ATO each and every year the dividends are paid, after you commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP!</p>',0),(104,330,'<p>\n	At the time you commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP, your SMSF Investments may have unrealized capital gains. To the extent you commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP you may never actually pay tax on these unrealized capital gains! Ever! Example: Assume you have acquired BHP Shares in 2003 for $100,000 and they are now valued at $300,000. Once you commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP you will never pay tax on the unrealized capital gains on these capital gains. Accordingly in the example provided if you sell the BHP Shares the day after commencing the Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP you will not pay tax on the increase in value of $200,000. Interestingly if you sold the same shares the day before commencing a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP you would pay tax on the entire capital gain of $200,000 (ie $20,000 in tax). The timing of the sale in the example results in a tax saving of $20,000.</p>',0),(105,331,'<p>\n	Income paid after the commencement of the Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP will be tax free if received after commencing the Pension even if it relates to an Investment made before the Pension commences. <b>Example:</b> Assume you have invested your Super Benefit in a 1 Year Term Deposit. Ten months into the Term Deposit you decide to commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP. The Interest is subsequently paid two months later at the maturity of the Term Deposit. <b>In the case the Interest would be completely tax free as it was paid after the Pension commencement! </b></p>',0),(106,332,'<p>\n	You can continue contributing to your SMSF even after you commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP subject to the contribution rules which can be found <mct:link><mct:url>http://www.esuperfund.com.au/education/contributions/NonConcessional/under65.aspx</mct:url><mct:target>NEW</mct:target><mct:label>here</mct:label></mct:link> on our website. That is if you are aged under 65 you can contribute to your SMSF even after commencing a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP with no work test required. If you are aged between 65 and 75 you can contribute to your SMSF even after commencing a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP if you have worked for at least 40 hours in a period of not more than 30 consecutive days in the particular financial year. You should bear in mind that Concessional Contributions (which include Employer and Salary Sacrificed Contributions) continue to be subject to tax at 15 even after you commence a Pension.</p>',0),(107,333,'<p>\n	Before you commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP your SMSF Benefit is recorded in your &quot;Accumulation Account&quot;. When you commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP your SMSF Benefit is transferred and recorded in your &quot;Pension Account&quot;. These are simply Accounting Entries in your SMSF and do not require separate Bank Accounts for each Account Type. Unlike Retail Funds, a SMSF can accept Contributions (subject to the normal Contributions Rules) and Rollovers after the Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP has commenced. These Contributions and Rollovers continue to be made to the SMSF ANZ V2 Plus Bank Account setup for your SMSF. When you make additional Contributions and Rollovers to your SMSF after you commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP, these Contributions and Rollovers are allocated to your &quot;Accumulation Account&quot;. This will mean that you will have two &ldquo;Accounting Accounts&rdquo; at the same time in this case, namely a &quot;Pension Account&quot; paying your Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP and an &quot;Accumulation Account&quot; which represents the additional Contributions and Rollovers made to your SMSF after commencing the Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP. The difference between each Account is the &quot;Pension Account&quot; does not pay tax on income and realised capital gains but the &quot;Accumulation Account&quot; does pay tax on income and realised capital gains at up to15.</p>',0),(108,334,'<p>\n	Merging the &ldquo;Accumulation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pension&rdquo; Accounts means that the Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP commenced must be &quot;commuted&quot; (ie stopped), and both the Accumulation and Pension Accounts merged. A new Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP with your total benefit is then commenced. In fact as part of the annual compliance preparation process ESUPERFUND will review each Members &ldquo;Accumulation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pension&rdquo; Account balance. Where the Member has a balance in their &ldquo;Accumulation Account&rdquo; ESUPERFUND will automatically merge the balance in the &ldquo;Accumulation&rdquo; Account with the Members &ldquo;Pension&rdquo; Account. This process is administratively burdensome so it is usually recommended that this &quot;merging process&quot; occurs only once per annum on 1 July. The great news is that ESUPERFUND will automatically merge these accounts to ensure your Super Benefit retains its tax free status. And it&rsquo;s FREE!</p>',0),(109,335,'<p>\n	<b>Step 1:</b> Determine the Tax Free Component of your Super Benefit</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Step 2:</b> Determine the Taxable Component of your Super Benefit</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Step 3:</b> The Total of the Taxable and Tax Free Components make up your Total Super Benefit</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Step 4:</b> Calculate the Tax Free Component percentage equal to Note 1 divided by Note 3</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Step 5:</b> Calculate the Taxable Component percentage equal to Note 2 divided by Note 3</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Step 6:</b> Multiply the Pension Payment by the Tax Free percentage at Note 4. The result is Tax Free.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Step 7:</b> Multiply the Pension Payment by the Taxable percentage at Note 5. The result is taxed at the Members tax rate less a 15% Pension Rebate.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Example</b> As an example assume you have a Super Benefit of $500,000 made up as follows: &ldquo;Tax Free&rdquo; Component: $400,000 &ldquo;Taxable&rdquo; Component: $100,000 Total Super Benefit: $500,000 In this example your &ldquo;Tax Free&rdquo; percentage is 80% ($400,000 / $500,000) and your &ldquo;Taxable&rdquo; percentage is 20% ($100,000 / $500,000). Under the &ldquo;Proportioning Rule&rdquo; this means that 80% of your Pension withdrawals will be tax free and 20% will be taxable where the pension withdrawals are made between the age of 55 and 59. Assume you draw the minimum pension of 4% per annum on your $500,000 Super Benefit (ie $20,000). The Pension withdrawn of $20,000 will be 80% tax free (ie $16,000) and 20% taxable (ie $4,000). In addition you will be allowed a 15% &ldquo;Pension Rebate&rdquo; on the taxable portion of the Pension withdrawn, further reducing your tax liability. In the above example assuming you are on the 31.50% personal marginal tax rate, you would be assessable on the $4,000 taxable portion of the Pension withdrawn at 31.50%, resulting in $1,260 in tax. Given you also receive a 15% &ldquo;Pension Rebate&rdquo; on the taxable portion of the Pension withdrawn of $4,000 (ie 15% of $4,000 or $600), the tax liability is further reduced to only $660. This means you pay tax of $660 on a $20,000 Pension withdrawal in the above example. In many cases given that minimal tax may be payable on Pension withdrawals when aged between 55 and 59, it may still be advisable to commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP even when aged under age 60, given you pay no tax on the income and realised capital gains on your Super Benefit within the SMSF. However you will need to assess your own individual circumstances to determine if a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP should be commenced before the age of 60. Our Interactive Pension Calculator can assist you in this decision and the calculator can be found <mct:link><mct:url>http://www.esuperfund.com.au/Interactive/PensionAnalysis.aspx</mct:url><mct:target>NEW</mct:target><mct:label>here</mct:label></mct:link>.</p>',0),(110,336,'This depends on the amount of the Lump Sum Withdrawal made. Your Super Benefit is made up of two components, namely a Tax Free Component and a Taxable Component. The Tax Free Component typically comes from after tax personal Non Concessional Contributions made by you over time. The Taxable Component typically comes from Concessional Contributions made by you over time which include Employer Contributions and Salary Sacrifice Contributions. Any Lump Sum Withdrawals must be paid in the same proportion as the Tax Free and Taxable Components of the Member&rsquo;s interest in the SMSF. This requirement is known as the &ldquo;Proportioning Rule&rdquo;. Under the &ldquo;Proportioning Rule&rdquo; and where the Member is aged between age 55 and 59, the &ldquo;Tax Free&rdquo; Component of the Lump Sum withdrawal is tax free. The &ldquo;Taxable&rdquo; Component of the Lump Sum withdrawal is taxed as follows: The First $160,000 of your Taxable Component is tax free. The next $160,000 of your Taxable Component is taxed at 16.50% Remember if you have commenced a Simple Account Based Pension it means you are retired and this is a precondition to being able to take Lump Sum withdrawals. <mct:input><b>Example</b></mct:input>',0),(111,337,'<p>\n	In order to commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP you need to provide the Market Value of your SMSF at the Pension commencement date. Logistically this means that you can only apply to establish a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP after the intended setup date as this is the only way you can know what the Market Value of the SMSF is at the date of commencement. It is important to understand that the documentation provided to you will be dated the date you want to commence the Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP. This ensures that you do not lose any valuable taxation savings. <b>Example:</b> Assume you want to commence a Simple Account Based Pension or TRAP on 1 July 2010. This means that you should complete our Online Pension Application Form sometime after this date. There is no set timeframe after the intended date you should Apply Online, however it should generally be within 30 days. Assuming you apply on say 10 July 2010, all documentation will be sent to you after this date, but it will be dated 1 July 2010 as this was your intended start date.
